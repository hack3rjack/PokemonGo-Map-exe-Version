# PokemonGo-Map-exe-Version
an exe builder and automated installation script for PokemonGo-Map on Windows

BuildInstall.bat creates a self extracting executable out of the files contained in \PogomapInstall. For now you can just run \PogomapInstall\install.bat which will save you a step.

Currently the EXE installer is broken, still trying to sort that out. For now, use \PogomapInstall\install.bat

If you want to use an alternate branch than Develop, swap out the folder \PogomapInstall\PokemonGo-Map with the branch you want to use
